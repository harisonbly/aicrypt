        <p>To conquer the lower nature and reveal the glory of the Devine is the purpose of
        Sadhana
        <br>========<br>
        To destroy the ego-sense is not an easy task
        <br>=======<br>
        It often poses as the Supreme Himself and leads him astray.
        <br>=======<br>
        Instead of of being the slave of the mind, he should be the master of it.
        <br>=======<br>
        God will remove all your sadness and pain. Affirming.
        <br>=======<br>
        God's mastery in the human vehicle is evident in all its sublimity.
        <br>=======<br>
        A victory achieved, brings him a state of perfect freedom and bliss.
        <br>=======<br>
        To relise God is to assert his own immortal and devine Self.
        <br>=======<br>
        Sadhaka should cling to God with all his strength.
        <br>=======<br>
        As we sow, so we reap.
        <br>=======<br>
        Union with Him, which is the end and aim of the life.
        <br>=======<br>
        All ambitions other than God are bubbles of the world which are transitory, which cannot give lasting peace.
        <br>=======<br>
        "Good or evil, thinking makes it so".
        <br>=======<br>
        God makes us do only what He wants.
        <br>=======<br>
        </p>
